\subsubsection{map\_o3.txt + so\_o3\_ie.txt}

In this experiment the covariance matrices for the process $R$ and measurement noise $Q$ were set to:

\[
R =
\begin{bmatrix}
    0.01^2  & 0			& 0 \\
    0       & 0.01^2 	& 0 \\
    0       & 0 		& (\frac{2\pi}{360})^2 \\

\end{bmatrix}
\]


\[
Q =
\begin{bmatrix}
    0.01^2  & 0 \\
    0       & (\frac{2\pi}{360})^2 \\

\end{bmatrix}
\]

The EKF's performance in this setting is very good, despite the poor odometry. As it seems a standard deviation of $1$cm and $1$ degree for the odometry information
is enough for it to diverge significantly from the actual path. However, the EKF is robust enough and tracks the path without significant errors. Interestingly enough, 
the spikes in the covariance plots seem to correspond to the landmarks that belong to a certain symmetry, i.e the uncertainty in the uniqueness of a landmark is
increased as expected.

Figure \ref{fig:iii3_1} shows the output of the EKF for this experiment.

\subsubsection{map\_pent\_big\_40.txt + so\_pb\_40\_no.txt}

In this experiment the covariance matrices for the process $R$ and measurement noise $Q$ were set to:

\[
R =
\begin{bmatrix}
    1^2  	& 0			& 0 \\
    0       & 1^2 		& 0 \\
    0       & 0 		& 1^2 \\

\]


\[
Q =
\begin{bmatrix}
    0.1^2  & 0 \\
    0      & 0.1^2 \\

\end{bmatrix}

The vulnerability of the sequential update method to high noise values is clearly illustrated here,
as it is apparent that the EKF cannot track the true state as well as the batch batch update method.
The effect is made more severe, since outliers are not to be rejected.
Notably, the error values in estimation in the sequential update are almost $50$ times larger than
in the batch update.

Figure \ref{fig:iii33_s} shows the output of the EKF for this experiment using sequential update.

Matlab's output for the experiment was:

\textbf{mean error(x, y, theta)} = (-2.618506, -1.733604, 0.439642)

\textbf{mean absolute error} = (4.462436, 4.795607, 0.440101)

\textbf{total time} = 18.211545


Conversely, the batch update method's nature of associating all measurements with the landmarks simultaneously
proves to be impervious to high noise. Furthermore, the fact that outliers are not rejected furthers the claim of robustness of the method.
Notably, the computational cost is not only comparable but even less than that of the sequential method in terms of execution time.
